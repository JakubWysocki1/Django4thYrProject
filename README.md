# Music Critique/Review Website

On this website users will be able to view, review and comment on the newest or trending songs. The general idea is to pull down songs from Spotify using their API and display them on the website. The website should be intuitive, minimalistic and simple as the target audience is anyone who is interested in music weather, theyâ€™re 10 years old or 100

For this project the focus is on the top trending songs. Top 50 songs from different regions will be used and put into separate categories according to the region
